**Skit Book Club**
                           Journal

This is the public journal of [Skit's](https://skit.ai/) Book Club (SBC). While SBC was started in January 2022, we have had many older book clubs at Skit. One of them is archived [here](https://skit-ai.github.io/several-people-are-talking/).

In this journal we maintain list of items, and possibly notes, that are discussed in our weekly meetings[^1].

*You can edit this journal [here](https://github.com/skit-ai/sbc/edit/main/index.html)*
